# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This repository appears to be a new or empty project named "tgsplat". The directory currently contains only Claude Code configuration files.

## Development Setup

Since this is an empty repository, development commands and architecture will need to be established as the project grows.

## Project Structure

The repository is currently minimal with only:
- `.claude/` - Claude Code configuration directory

## Getting Started

This appears to be a fresh project. Consider initializing it with:
- Choose a programming language and framework
- Set up build tools and dependency management
- Create initial project structure
- Add README.md with project description

## Future Development

Once the project structure is established, this CLAUDE.md should be updated to include:
- Build and test commands
- Project architecture overview
- Development workflow
- Key directories and their purposes
